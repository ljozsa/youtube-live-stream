"This presentation is about OSBS, why it was created, how it was developed and what the future plans. The presentation would show what other parts a good buildsystem needs other than 'docker build', how OSBS is integrated in release pipeline.<br /> <br /> The final part of the presentation would cover other topics for OSBS - flatpak building, coupled with Modularity efforts and future OCI tools/containers support."
"The rapid growth of unstructured data is fueling the need for a next generation storage that’s flexible, economical, and scalable enough to handle the petabytes of data being created every day. Object storage is the answer!<br /> <br /> Ceph is a highly available distributed software defined storage, that provides two object storage interfaces:<br /> Rados provides native object storage API using a rich library with C/C++, java, python, go and several others bindings.<br /> Ceph RGW (Rados Gateway) provides HTTP REST API that is Amazon S3 and openstack swift compatible.<br /> In this talk I will introduce object storage foundations, best practices and Ceph object storage solution."
"PipeWire is a multimedia API that makes it easier to build distributed<br /> real-time multimedia pipelines. It was originally built to provide shared access to<br /> cameras but it can also be used to build a variety of multimedia services<br /> such as a sound server. PipeWire is built on top of a new low-level plugin API (SPA for Simple Plugin API) that is designed to be simple, efficient and suitable for hard real-time processing.<br /> <br /> In this presentation I want to talk about the design ideas, the current status<br /> and the future plans for PipeWire."
"DevOps adoption has increased rapidly over the last few years and with it the guidelines, practices, and tool that support this journey. Nevertheless, finding the right path towards DevOps is challenging for most organizations. In this session, we will discuss why containers and container orchestrators have proven to be a key enabler for DevOps practices with examples from real-world implementations and furthermore, you will learn about 10 ways that Kubernetes is helping teams to get ahead in their DevOps initiatives combined with a live demo of some of the techniques discussed."
"Microservices are exciting to build but complex to manage and operate. In this session you will see a live demo of polyglot microservices application and how a day in a developers life looks like when they have to take a change into production without risking any production downtime using a continuous delivery pipeline and zero downtime deployment techniques such as blue/green deployment. But what about security? We will also show how to integrate security scanning into the deployment pipeline to make sure no changes go into production with known security risks."
"Dev teams are transitioning from on-premise, monolithic applications to highly dynamic, polyglot environments using microservices and cloud computing. Although microservices is the main focal point, cloud-native applications are about much more than just an architectural style and require teams to adjust accordingly in order to successfully take advantage of cloud-native application benefits and deliver quicker while reducing risks. This session is a live-coding session to demonstrate creating a cloud-native retail app from the ground up using microservices frameworks like Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm and Vert.x live on stage and build a deployment pipeline to automate delivery and promotion of the microservices to production using Red Hat OpenShift."
"The Linux locking primitives (spinlocks, rwlocks, mutex, rw semaphores<br /> and futexes) have undergone substantial changes in recent years to<br /> improve their performance and scalability. This talk will present<br /> the new locking implementations like qspinlock, qrwlock as well as<br /> improvements to existing mutex, rw semaphore and futex code bases. It <br /> will also discuss new locking patches that are being proposed to be<br /> merged in future kernel releases. After the session, the audience will<br /> have a better understanding of the locking improvements and what to<br /> expect in the near future."
"Container oriented development is a new way to adopt for today's developers. Although base tooling allow easy and simple deployment to be adopted, developers needs more accurate tools to deal with their day to day operations.<br /> <br /> Based on the Eclipse Docker and OpenShift tooling, we will discover how developer tasks can be easily managed from the Eclipse IDE:<br /> - managing containers, images<br /> - dealing with complex deployments<br /> - deploying and debugging local projects inside launched containers<br /> <br /> We will walk from a simple scenario (Docker image build) to a more complex real case scenario where our application deployed on a cloud provider is remotely debugged. Everything from within the Eclipse IDE !!!"
"Look Mom, No Dockerfile! We'll build a multi-container project from scratch without writing any Dockerfiles. You'll learn how Ansible Container works, the container.yml syntax, how to build images using only Ansible roles, and how to orchestrate containers locally on your laptop. <br /> <br /> But we're not stopping there! We'll deploy our new application to OpenShift. You'll learn how Ansible Container translates your project to K8s configuration files, how it performs the deployment, and some best practices you can implement to make your app production ready."
"In the Cockpit project we’ve done something amazing: We’ve built a team that’s part human and part machine working on an Open Source project. “Cockpituous”, our project’s #5 commit contributor, is actually our automated team members.<br /> <br /> Bots do the mundane tasks that would otherwise use up the time of human contributors. You can see them self-organizing, doing continuous integration, finding issues, contributing code changes, making decisions, releasing the software into Linux distros and containers. They work in a distributed, organic way, and run in containers on Openshift.<br /> <br /> We’ll talk about how humans are training the bots, and how bots are using machine learning to learn from the humans.<br /> <br /> Treating the bots as team members is fundamental to achieving this."
"Software provisioning is a common task repeated at many high performance computing (HPC) sites to provide the local users with scientific applications and libraries. As the effort to compile HPC software is known to be duplicated by many HPC sites, the idea to collaborate in a community led to the creation of the OpenHPC project.<br /> <br /> In this talk I want to provide an introduction to OpenHPC, its community efforts and how it can help HPC sites.<br /> <br /> In addition to the OpenHPC introduction I want to describe how the OpenHPC community effort is used as upstream for the CentOS HPC SIG. I want to present the current status of the HPC SIG and the future goals."
"This presentation is an overview of some advanced techniques to use in containerization. We'll start with a simple container image and at the end of this presentation we should end with a next-gen container image! More details:<br /> <br /> * s2i-enabled services<br /> * distgen<br /> * container testing<br /> * Ansible Container<br /> * module-based containers<br /> * Best practices for containerization<br /> <br /> Outcome:<br /> * Audience is familiar with present technologies to utilize in container images<br /> * People know about best practices"
"Several types of workload require a GPU acceleration. As we tend to virtualize<br /> everything, virtual machines are expected to provide the same level of<br /> acceleration. That is possible by using a device assignment, where a VM has<br /> access to a physical GPU isolated by IOMMU. Such approach does not really work for hypervisors with dozens of VMs. To solve that, GPU virtualization<br /> technologies such as vGPU or GVT-g enable sharing a single physical GPU between multiple virtual machines. On Linux, this capability is enabled by using<br /> virtualization-capable GPU, appropriate GPU driver and VFIO mediated devices<br /> (or vfio-mdev) driver. Attendees will learn about GPU virtualization basics,<br /> vfio-mdev sysfs interface and experience from implementing the feature in<br /> management software - oVirt."
"Bugs that corrupts the memory are extremely annoying. The corruption is<br /> often silent as it happens, and only become apparent later when the<br /> corrupted address is being accessed, possibly by a totally unrelated<br /> code, and all useful information about the context in which the<br /> corruption occurred has been lost.<br /> <br /> KASan (Kernel Address Sanitizer) is a tool that allow to catch the<br /> faulty accesses that cause memory corruption as they happen, and thus<br /> greatly facilitate the debugging of such issue<br /> <br /> In this talk, I'll explain what are the common causes of memory<br /> corruption, how KASan works, how to use it and, I hope, inspire kernel<br /> developer to use it more."
"This deck tries to gather a series of best practices directly from 'the trenches', where the development of ansible roles is at odds with the elegance of the implementation and sometimes with delivery times. This talk deals with points such as code reuse, role tests, variable inheritance, SCM management, Debugging strategies, etc..."
"Kerberos has long been a demand of the enterprise environment, and there's a<br /> lot for security-conscious developers to like that we often don't talk about.<br /> <br /> I'll touch on what makes Kerberos nice from a security perspective, but the<br /> focus of the talk will be on enablement: how can you use these cool features<br /> in your software?<br /> <br /> Some features, time permitting, that will be discussed include: OTP and second<br /> factor support, public key authentication, SAML/SPNEGO and web logins, python<br /> bindings, and, of course, the more traditional authentication/encryption<br /> routes. Expect canned demos!<br /> <br /> Very basic familiarity with Kerberos is expected (i.e., the first two<br /> paragraphs of the Wikipedia article), but this talk won't go very far into how<br /> Kerberos works internally."
"Containers are all the rage, alongside cloud and DevOps. Sometimes they also induce rage. In this talk, we will take a look at using Fedora Atomic on your desktop, when it makes sense, and what the potential benefits vs drawbacks of having a container-based OS on your desktop are for you as a developer.<br /> <br /> You will learn:<br /> <br /> * what Atomic Host is<br /> * how it compares to CoreOS<br /> * that you can use container-based OS on your desktop machine as well<br /> * if and why that makes sense from a developer's perspective<br /> * how to do it effectively<br /> <br /> No maximum for attendees, no specific requirements, the talk is beginner-friendly, but some existing knowledge of containers is advised."
"We been pushing Fedora Workstation for 3 years now and have successfully grown the userbase significantly. At the same time changes within Red Hat and in the marketplace has affected some of the plans made so this talk will both cover some of major milestones we achieved, but also talk about the items we need to focus on going forward to keep growing."
"Containers are everywhere. Most applications today make use of multiple containers in their architecture. Very often, you need to test changes to one or more of your containers prior to moving them into production. Using Openshift as the platform and using Jenkins pipelines and the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin, I will present how to setup your workflow and help guide you on how to achieve efficient container CI.<br /> <br /> Phoebe Talk #2"
"Over the past couple years we have restructured the Server Edition of Fedora. The Server Edition is a good starting point as it has fewer GUI requirements, a strong need for parallel availability of versions, and a user base that is most representative of those with the muscle memory we want to support. <br /> <br /> For this talk, we will be demonstrating how this “modular distro” works, the UX of using this new distribution, a discussion of how & why modules provide the flexibility we are looking for, and examples of creating and building modules. Finally, we will also demonstrate some cool features the module-aware distribution provides for the simplification of container development and maintenance."
"From time to time, especially with new version of operating system, new errors may show up, and sometimes they are accompanied by AVC denials, pointing to errors in SELinux policy. When that happens for example in Fedora, as a good community member you might be inclined to just file bug against selinux-policy.<br /> That might however leave the package maintainer out of the loop and not lead to proper fix. Enforcing SELinux sometimes discovers real bugs, real regressions, and it should ideally be embraced by all maintainers.<br /> We will look at real-life examples when AVC denials have actually helped to uncover real bugs."
"WebAssembly is a new low-level binary compile format that will do a better job at being a compiler target than JavaScript. It’s being called “the future of the web platform” and did you know that its promising features in terms of speed, reusability and safety has brought major browser vendors working together to make it a reality and the MVP is already available in major browsers.<br /> <br /> Want to know how WebAssembly work? Why is WebAssembly so fast? How to build web apps using C/C++/Rust? In this talk we’ll look at history, basics, applications and deep dive into the core concepts of WebAssembly with help of live demos and coding. <br /> <br /> Session Content :<br /> - Introduction to WebAssembly<br /> - Live Demos<br /> - History & Need of WebAssembly<br /> - Applications of WebAssembly <br /> - Community Details & support Channels"
"In this presentation Michael will demonstrate how to create and deploy Python based Apache Spark applications to cloud native environments. We will explore design patterns to help you integrate your analytics and machine learning algorithms into applications which can take full advantage of cloud native platforms like OpenShift Origin. You will see code samples and live demonstrations of techniques for building and deploying Apache Spark applications written in Python. These samples and techniques will provide a solid basis that you can use to create your own intelligent applications for the cloud."
"The current Fedora approach to delivering SELinux policy is to deliver the<br /> entire distribution policy in a single RPM package. This approach worked well<br /> when SELinux was first introduced, but as the legacy Fedora model starts to<br /> shift towards a decomposed, modular approach so should the Fedora SELinux<br /> policy. This talk will introduce the SELinux Modularity concepts, including<br /> a discussion of why the change is necessary and the advantages of shipping,<br /> and supporting, a modular SELinux policy."
"Gluster [1] is free and open source software scalable network filesystem. A more complete overview of Gluster can be found at [2].<br /> <br /> Gluster-4.0 is the new upcoming major release of GlusterFS, planned for very early 2018. GlusterD-2.0 (GD2) is the distributed management framework used in Gluster-4.0, that is more scalable and easier to use and integrate with than before.<br /> <br /> The presentation will provide a attendees with an overview of Gluster, Gluster-4.0 and GD2. Existing users will get to know what to expect when upgrading to Gluster-4.0. New users will get to know what Gluster is, and how it could help them. Developers will get to know how they can develop and integrate with Gluster-4.0 and GD2.<br /> <br /> [1]: https://www.gluster.org/<br /> [2]: http://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Install-Guide/Overview/"
"Eclipse Che is a browser-based IDE providing on-demand workspaces that include runtimes and IDEs. It is powered by a RESTful workspace server (with Docker, OpenShift of Kubernetes as underlying infra), plug-ins for languages, framework, and tools.<br /> <br /> In this session, we will demonstrate how to boost the power of Eclipse Che with Keycloak to build a collaborative developer environment. We will also discuss how to manage teams, groups, organizations, and permissions for fine-grained access to APIs and resources.<br /> <br /> [1] https://www.eclipse.org/che/<br /> [2] http://www.keycloak.org/<br /> [3] https://www.openshift.com/"
"Devops people maintaining small infrastructures with no SLAs do not see area of testing and verification of IaaC as important as people who are maintaining large infrastructures and need to deliver features or rolling updates in fast and reliable manner. As soon as IaaC repository gets a little bigger the time spend on manual testing becomes a bottle neck.<br /> <br /> Contributing to public IaaC repositories can also be painful when both contributor and maintainer do not have a way to automatically check if their code will not break supported environments.<br /> <br /> So how should we test our IaaC repositories?<br /> <br /> This talk will introduce ideal way for testing of IaaC and show what features can tool Test-Kitchen provide to meet requirements and help with automated testing and verification of IaaC repositories."
"In general, software quality engineering engages after a deveolper finishes a task. Agile approach, however, does not have a fragmented view about the team, which acts in a multidisciplinary way. How could us introduce agile techniques to a traditionally structured team? As outcome of my session, atendees will be able to identify opportunities to apply agile techniques on their daily activities, such as reviewing quality backlog, creating agile test cases integrated with feature sprint backlogs, designing test cases automation and evaluating application performance and scalability. Another outcome will be to show how Hawkular QE is engaging with developers on agile. <br /> <br /> The session should have a range of 40 to 100 atendees."
"PKCS #11 3.0 is the first new major release of PKCS #11 since 2.0. There are several new features including the ability to add new functions to PKCS #11 in a backward compatible way. This feature is used to add AEAD algorithms (AES GCM, CHACHA/POLY) is a more seamless way. The feature is also used to allow better fork() semantics in PKCS #11 3.0. The talk will go over the new features in 3.0 with the idea of encouraging the adoption of those new features in open source products. The new spec is expected to be final just before dev conf. If it's not, the talk will update when the spec is expected to come out."
"With the rise of Docker, we have seen an unprecedented interest from developers in container technologies. Many agree that they are highly beneficial for modern practices like Agile and DevOps. But there is a new kid in town that proclaims a more radical approach called Serverless. It suggests that you should only write high-level functions and react to events. The underlying compute infrastructure is transparent to the user. That raises the question: Should you still write your own containers? And who now needs containers in a serverless world?<br /> <br /> In this talk we confront these two approaches from a containers advocate and serverless fanboy viewpoints. We show the differences, individual strengths and weaknesses and where they complement each other."
"Qemu sandbox is a security feature that filters system calls from the guest to the host avoiding possible malicious exploits. The filter uses libseccomp that uses the in-kernel seccomp filter. The main goal of this talk is to spread the feature to a broader audience, expecting them to use, test and improve the security of virtualization when using Qemu."
"When implementing true CI/CD you can deliver a host platform at a quicker cadence and high quality. This session walks through using Red Hat Opensource products such as Openshift, Jenkins, and Ansible to deliver a faster moving host completely containerized and gates developers/packagers. Every change gets validated and prevents bugs in code to be identified sooner by the person making changes. I will explore how Openshift + Jenkins Pipelines is a simpler comprehensive solution to enable CI/CD in any project based on lessons learned by delivering a host platform.<br /> <br /> References:<br /> https://github.com/CentOS-PaaS-SIG/ci-pipeline<br /> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtURsOwIYbRmaxucfTcbXMA/featured<br /> <br /> Phoebe talk #1"
"Developing a modern CI/CD workflow involves the integration of multiple technologies and applications/services. Openshift helps to simplify the provisioning, management and scaling of applications and, thanks to its tight integration with Jenkins, is a perfect choice for your CI/CD pipeline. This talk will provide an introduction to minishift[1] as a way for developers to have their own easy to implement, manage, and customize Openshift instance on their local development system, and how to use this minishift-based Openshift environment in conjunction with Jenkins to implement a full local CI-Pipeline.<br /> <br /> References:<br /> [1] https://www.openshift.org/minishift/<br /> <br /> Phoebe talk #3"
"Imagine you have four different databases, five popular languages, and six other interesting technologies, that you want to put into container image, make them nicely run in OpenShift, and support for few years. However, you soon realize that you want to support not only one version of the particular technology, and the images are not based on one distribution only. Then you easily find yourself developing and maintaining hundred of container images or more.<br /> <br /> Something similar happened to us and I admit we did not know all the tricks from the first minute. Come and hear what issues we met during the way, so you do not repeat them as well. We will cover upstream/downstream design, de-duplication of the sources from more perspectives, automation based on Jenkins, and of course testing."
"Gluster storage is integrated with oVirt as file based storage using FUSE, enabling all oVirt features with very little special code. However FUSE is not the most efficient and scalable way to access Gluster storage, resulting in poor virtual machine performance. With newly added native Gluster support a VM can access gluster storage directly in the most efficient way. Decreased storage access latency results in a better IOPS, thus making storage more responsive and improve the VMs performance. Participants will be able to learn more on how file system access works for VMs, review the reason for potential performance issues in hyperconverged setups, and how to improve it."
"The deadline scheduler adds the ability of scheduling tasks, according to a dynamic priority, based on the task’s deadline. Using the period, the runtime, and deadline, the scheduler tries to provide the runtime CPU time, at each period for each deadline task, providing the guarantee real-time tasks need, *under the perfect conditions*, these conditions are:<br /> <br /> - Implicit deadline tasks<br /> - Tasks should not self-suspend<br /> - All the system’s delay must be taken into account<br /> - The runtime must represent the worst-case execution time<br /> - The system should not be overload<br /> <br /> All these restrictions open the opportunity for improvements in the deadline scheduler. This presentation aims to list these points of improvement, point directions and challenges"
"Do you want to know how Smart Cards can help you improve security and work efficiently?<br /> Smart cards are among us for decades, but they are still not widely used on daily basis by most of us, even though they provide significant advantages for both security and usability and all the tools are open source in Linux. Smart cards are no longer only credit-card sized cards, but also more practical USB dongles which are frequently combined with other features such as OTP or U2F, which can take this even further.<br /> I will go through architecture of smart cards and show you how they can be used to simplify your work."
"Today, it’s difficult for developers to write applications, learn Kubernetes, and then define how to deploy on Kubernetes. Kubernetes is very powerful, but it also very verbose. <br /> Kedge is a simple and easy way to define and deploy applications to Kubernetes. It helps developers by simplifying “the getting started on Kubernetes experience” without compromising on the power of Kubernetes. Among other things it has support for smart completion in editors using the Language Server Protocol. <br /> This talk will introduce the simple Kedge format to define Kubernetes applications and demo the complete application lifecycle and workflow with Kedge and minikube/minishift (from local dev environment to production).<br /> Project: https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge"
"Unikernels are a hot and contentious topic.<br /> <br /> In this talk we will first introduce the concept of Unikernels, compare them to alternative technologies and look at developments of the last year - no revolution but various projects have advanced well.<br /> <br /> We will see some real Unikernel demos of specialized networking applications running on Kubernetes/OpenShift"
"Kubernetes got several interesting storage related features:<br /> <br /> - Snapshots<br /> - Local volumes<br /> - Resizeable volumes<br /> - Container Storage Interface (CSI)<br /> - Mount propagation<br /> <br /> Live demos!<br /> <br /> [Note that I can squeeze it into one slot sacrificing demos]"
"Hydra, the integration layer for Red Hat’s CE&E division, has been in active development for just over a year. Hydra's mandate: Unify numerous applications with crucial functionality yet questionable resilience/reliability. Learn how to win the balancing act between a single organized space for code/business logic and modular, multi-national development with a microservices-esque deployment. Accomplished using open-source software solutions including JBoss Fuse, ActiveMQ, Camel, and ultimately built/deployed via Openshift. In this session, we feature the full app life cycle, from finding a bug to fixed in prod running with failover/HA. Identify/avoid common process pitfalls, pain points and what we’re doing to enhance the developer experience through automation and DevOps technologies."
"Building, Composing and testing an Atomic release<br /> <br /> In this session I'll show how we migrated our workflow from using Jenkins Job Builder on bare metal to running everything inside openshift with Jenkins pipeline and containers. We took an iterative approach of containerizing each piece of the pipeline and then moving those containers into openshift itself. I'll share lessons learned and what we found to be best practices.<br /> <br /> References:<br /> https://github.com/CentOS-PaaS-SIG/ci-pipeline/<br /> <br /> Phoebe talk #4"
"Lack of usability is the most ubiquitous hindrance to the success of open source security software. If you have ever spent way too much time trying to generate your GPG keys or done a `setenforce 0` because you didn’t feel like debugging your SELinux violations then you know what I’m talking about. <br /> <br /> The content of this talk will take the audience through my journey designing and building Karn, a seccomp and apparmor profile generator that uses high-level entitlements. The idea is to create a language anyone can understand for easily locking down containers without any over complications. We’ll laugh, we’ll cry, we’ll debug seccomp, and hopefully come out on the other side having learned a lesson on usable security.<br /> <br /> https://github.com/grantseltzer/karn"
"Flatpak is a new cross-distribution, sandboxing deployment mechanism<br /> for desktop applications. This talk will explain how you, as an<br /> upstream developer can create a flatpak version of your application,<br /> reaching a large audience and getting a more direct channel to your<br /> users.<br /> <br /> The session will start with the basics of building and distributing<br /> flatpaks, and then cover more advanced topics like how to tweak the<br /> sandbox to allow access to the things your app needs, and finally how<br /> you can modify your application to work better when sandboxed without<br /> such access."
"Serverless is getting increasingly popular as an architectural choice. Startups and cloud-native companies use it as a competitive advantage to faster develop products with shorter feedback cycles. So what is it about serverless? How can enterprise projects leverage these strengths?<br /> <br /> This talk will introduce serverless and discuss it's unique properties. It will propose development practices inspired by serverless. These practices range from basic like “Constrained Freedom”, “Decoupled Architecture”, “Tiny Teams” and “Pure DevOps”. And go to advanced practices like “Buy Before Build”, “Production Ready Releases” and “Ready For Experiments”. This talk will conclude by showing how “precise cost-based pricing” can be used to enable business-driven development also coined as FinDev."
"The presentation will start with a short introduction to the FIPS 140-2 US government standard, the reasons why it exists and what are the high level implications it has on the FIPS validated cryptography modules. It will also shortly describe what is the work done by Red Hat as the vendor of multiple FIPS validated modules to be able to obtain the FIPS validation.<br /> The main focus of the presentation will be on developers that wish to use cryptography in applications for various reasons - encryption of data, protection of its integrity through message digests and signatures, secure communication via TLS. In this part it will be shown what are the most important things to follow to be able to claim that the cryptography-using application is FIPS compliant."
"This talk will go through what Fleet Commander is (and, consequently, what Fleet Commander is *not* intended for), which are the solutions proposed by the project, how Fleet Commander interacts with SSSD and FreeIPA and, plans for the future and finally provide a Demo of the current state of the project."
"Do you like C#? Write and deploy your code on Fedora! Take a look at available IDE's, how to interact with Linux from C# code, and how easy it is to deploy.<br>"
"On the continuum from virtual machines to containers now Serverless presents a new alternative Cloud technology enabling developers to concentrate on their application and not the servers used to host them. The platform takes care of the infrastructure allowing it to scale or to be highly available.<br /> <br /> There are enormous advantages allowing to easily fire up new applications and autoscale them as they go viral.<br /> <br /> Let’s look at the public cloud offerings in the space (lambda, AF, GCF) and the Open Source projects (OpenWhisk, Fission, Serverless, OpenFaaS) and look at the pros & cons of each.<br /> <br /> In what use cases is PaaS more interesting than Serverless?<br /> <br /> There'll be demos of several Serverless frameworks including Apache OpenWhisk running on OpenShift."
"In this presentation, I will give an overview of the current state of GTK+ 4 development. This will include a high-level explanation of how rendering and input worked in GTK+ 3, what changes we are making for GTK+ 4, and why we are making them. <br /> I will show some examples of things that will become possible with GTK+ 4."
"IT industry is undergoing a major overhaul. Increased demand for big data analytics, cloud, mobile, edge, IoT, and HPC solutions often require our customers to look beyond traditional architectures, like x86_64. Learn how your involvement could help Red Hat during this paradigm shift and how multi-architecture initiative is spanning across the product portfolio that runs on IBM Power/System z or Arm architectures."
"When it comes to integrating nftables support into firewall-managing applications such as firewalld, in the past developers were presented with merely two options: either using the very low-level nftnl library or calling 'nft' utility and parsing its output. The latter is disapproved by the maintainer since 'nft' utility really is designed for human interaction. Making use of libnftnl on the other hand will lead to partial reimplementation of 'nft' utility internals - so not really an alternative either.<br /> <br /> A new library named libnftables aims to solve this. The presenter will give an overview of past, current and future development as well as a status report of integration into firewalld as alternative backend to the previous combination of iptables, ebtables and ipset."
"One of the most difficult hurdles any development project will ever encounter is the decision on when to cut their losses and move on to a new approach. In this session, I will discuss the concept of the sunk-cost fallacy, how to remain aware of it, how to avoid falling into it and how to climb out of it once you are there.<br /> <br /> I will provide several real-world examples of projects at Fedora and Red Hat that have had to make these decisions."
"Development Suite is a curated, integrated set of desktop tools. Desktop tools combine different components that are required by the developer to get an integrated development platform configured and running on your desktop. It is packaged in an easy-to-use installer and the components can be easily integrated and installed via the interactive web application that runs on MacOS and Windows.<br /> <br /> Key points:<br /> Developer Suite and its current features<br /> Vision of the product and supported OS<br /> Ease of installing components and its dependencies (Demo)<br /> Add new components and Ease of integration (Demo)<br /> <br /> link: https://github.com/redhat-developer-tooling/developer-platform-install/"
"Containers and the platforms that they run on are increasingly playing a crucial role in application architectures. Today, most of Red Hat’s application portfolio can be run as a container, and our Atomic and OpenShift platforms continue to be leaders in the space. In order to quickly and reliably release new versions, developers need to be able to test that their containers and container platforms function and meet Red Hat’s standards. In this talk, I’ll present how to use the container validation service to automate deployment and testing of containers and the platforms that host them.<br /> <br /> References:<br /> https://github.com/CentOS-PaaS-SIG/cvengine<br /> <br /> Phoebe Talk #5"
"As practitioners moved their code to cloud environments and microservice architectures, we saw the eschewing of TX for these apps. The prevalence of TX models employing locking could be cited as having an unacceptable impact on the scalability of the app.<br /> <br /> We will demonstrate with practical examples how a technique known as compensating transactions allows applications to maintain atomic outcomes without the need for coarse locking traditionally required.<br /> <br /> https://jbossts.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/sagas-and-how-they-differ-from-two.html<br /> <br /> Resources: HDMI projector<br /> <br /> Max attendees: Any"
"It’s no secret that people don’t usually read technical documentation for pleasure. Users often come to your docs when they are frustrated, disappointed and at their lowest. In this talk, we’ll discuss how the language we use affects our users, as well as the first steps towards writing accessible, use case-driven docs. <br /> <br /> Why people read documentation <br /> - Hint: it’s not because they want to be<br /> - Understanding the feelings of your users<br /> Analyzing the common doc language <br /> - Examples of effective and ineffective language<br /> An introduction to use case-driven documentation<br /> - Writing with a user in mind<br /> Accessible documentation<br /> - What does it mean for documentation to be accessible<br /> - Dos/don’ts<br /> - Available resources<br /> Close with a glorious, thought-provoking takeaway"
"This talk gives an overview of recent and current developments in the Linux kernel; it will discuss what major changes the latest kernel versions brought, what the next version will bring, and what the Linux developers are working on for future releases. In that scope the presentation will also discuss changes in software close to the kernel; that for example includes Mesa, as its 3D drivers and work hand in hand with the graphics drivers in the Linux kernel."
"Learn how to facilitate Linux kernel development by testing new kernels and reporting problems your find. This is important to make sure future Linux distribution run as good on your hardware as todays – which is in your own interest, as there is a high chance your systems are unique in this world and thus might trigger problems no one else will find while testing. .<br /> <br /> To do this you'll learn how to install and run mainline kernel on Fedora, RHEL and CentOS without messing your system up. The talk will also explain how to report problems you find. During the talk Thorsten will also share some insights about his work as regression tracker for the Linux kernel."
"OSTree on Fedora can now handle multi platform, and a number of other issues with using Fedora IoT have improved which means we can start to accelerate the IoT SIG and engage in the wider community with usable demos. Where are we and where do we envision being in time for Fedora 28 and what's the short to medium roadmap"
"Highly available virtual machines are restarted automatically when going down unintentionally. Such VMs are often needed for running critical services. However, restarting VMs automatically is a non-trivial task for management systems because it may cause a VM to run on two different machines simultaneously. This scenario, called 'split-brain', may lead to data corruption since both instances use the same disk(s). That is especially unfortunate because highly available VMs are typically the most important ones. In this session I will describe the problem we faced and demonstrate our recent solution for this in oVirt (although both are not oVirt-specific). No special resources are needed and there's no limit on the number of attendees."
"1000 Python 2 packages were renamed for the new naming rules<br /> ('python2-' prefixes) in F28.<br /> <br /> Spec files can be arbitrarily complex. Changes were automatized using<br /> pattern matching and heuristics.<br /> <br /> Proven Packager permissions and Mass Package Change procedure were<br /> used to interact with the huge number of packages and packagers.<br /> <br /> Issues occured: bugs in the design _and_implementation, external<br /> problems such as infrastrucure hiccups and many packages FTBFS, some<br /> maintainers not being thrilled.<br /> <br /> This talk is about:<br /> <br /> - new python package guidelines and why packages are being renamed,<br /> <br /> - an introduction to the Mass Package Change procedure,<br /> <br /> - pitfalls and things to watch out for in package renames and when<br /> touching packages of other maintainers,<br /> <br /> - why such changes are worth doing."
"Samba AD is a free software implementation of Microsoft's Active Directory<br /> solution. It took more than five years to port Samba AD to MIT Kerberos and now<br /> it is a part of Fedora 27 release. However, the work does not stop here. Active <br /> Directory is a complex set of technologies and one of driving factors behind<br /> Fedora Server work is to make them easier to deploy and manage. The talk will<br /> go into details what is needed to be done to make Fedora a preferred<br /> distribution to deploy Samba AD."
"Linux kernel guarantees a stable ABI for the userland applications. However this is not the case for the kernel modules which have no guarantees from the kernel. Thus inspection and review of these changes is crucial for kernel module developers. In this talk we'll present traditional ABI changes detection techniques together with those based on comparison of the DWARF debugging data."
"NetworkManager manages the host networking trying to provide the best connectivity experience to the user, with no or minimal interaction.<br /> It is not uncommon when a user tries to take manual control of a network device by means of common networking tools, the user may end up fighting with NetworkManager: it will keep monitoring and managing the device.<br /> Don't kill NetworkManager... just talk to it!<br /> This session will bring you up to speed on some key concepts so you can use NetworkManager effectively. You will then learn the very few 'survival phrases' (cli commands) needed to tell NetworkManager how to configure your devices or even stop managing them."
"Talk describing how to bring Proactive security to your systems by ensuring that SELinux is enforcing the security policy. This process comprises of steps like relabeling files (i.e. fixing SELinux labels on the system), handling potentional SELinux denials in Permissive mode in which Security policy is not enforced. I'll explain how to have SELinux under control using our userspace tooling. The talk will conclude by showcasing how the changes done during this talk can be distributed to multiple systems using ansible."
"In order to adapt in a demanding and fast-paced release cadence that Openshift follows as a productized distribution of Kubernetes, one of the things we had to rethink as members of the Openshift Continuous Delivery team over the past months was how to scale our CI infrastructure to quickly and efficiently verify, test, and merge developer changes across multiple Github repositories, that eventually get delivered to our customers while boosting developer productivity at the same time. Moving our CI infrastructure and testing workloads to run on top of Openshift has been a monumental effort. I am going to walk through our CI infrastructure architecture and how we are moving workloads from Jenkins to Openshift."
"With the slowdown and end of Moore's Law the focus of processor manufacturers and users in high performance computing shifts toward innovations in the architectures as opposed to automatic speed-ups due to process improvements. The problem is that fully taking advantage of the new processor features does not come for free. At least development tool developers but also programmers should know about them. This talk will give an overview of processor architectures (desktop, server, GPGPU, other accelerators) of various manufacturers and over time and into the future. The benefits and pitfalls are presented. Problems which can be solved well with the newly developed features and ways to implement solutions are presented."
"Even though FPGAs have been around for a long time most developers don't know enough about them. While their predominant use was in the embedded realm they are used now as alternative accelerator and server and desktop environments. This talk will explain how and why FPGAs differ from normal processors. At the example of one FPGAs the talk will introduce everything from the programming languages used, the tools to translate them, the binaries produced, and how the code finally gets executed."
"In this talk, we will be explaining how to go from ground zero to create, build and deploy an app on cloud, leveraging all the latest development tools provided by Red Hat for a number of years. We will be installing all the required components and use them to create Python/Go application running on Openshift environment in matter of minutes.<br /> <br /> How is that possible?<br /> <br /> With Red Hat Development Suite Installer it is super easy to download, install and do some deep configuration. This sets up a fully functional development environment on any supported platform. We will be setting up Container Development Kit and Eclipse Che IDE to work together on the developer’s machine to build multi-container truly enterprise-grade applications."
"Building an open source product includes a lot of testing. Being able to test in every possible hardware is unrealistic, given all the possibilities. Instead on focusing on acquiring more hardware to test, we propose that you focus on a smarter and more open way of validating that your product works on different environments. Enters Distributed-CI (DCI).<br /> <br /> DCI is a platform where product teams constantly push the latest version of their product onto and partners constantly pull those bits and run their deployment on their own lab with their own configuration submitting back the test results. All that continuously and in an automated fashion.<br /> <br /> Come discover how DCI has been used for projects like OpenStack, and learn how we are working on expanding this to Fedora."
"ABRT (https://github.com/abrt/abrt/wiki) can automatically catch and report problems. I will show you how you can configure your private FAF (https://github.com/abrt/faf) how to alter your containers so crashes are sent to private FAF. How to send reports about crashes to Kubernetes and display detailed informations in Cockpit."
"This session introduces RedFish - the modern vendor-agnostic bare metal machine management protocol, developed by DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) and already supported by several major vendors, including HPE, Dell and Intel. We will start with historical perspective on hardware management and the reasons why RedFish appeared. Then we will explain the protocol basics, common applications and the mechanisms of OEM extensions. We will also mention related protocols that are under development for managing specific types of bare metal resources, such as network and storage hardware.<br /> We will conclude with a live demo of our own simple RedFish controller managing physical machines."
"Companies are becoming more and more global, with distributed team members spread all around the world. How we can succeed in delivering value if your team members is 10000Km away? What are the challenges we encounter when trying to be more Agile? What are the opportunities we can see and improve working with distributed teams. Leadership, communication, tools used, culture and many other things my impact a team's journey to become more Agile"
"In this session, you will learn everything you need to know to build high impact, sustainable teams.<br /> <br /> Are you looking for an expert that would provide a quick fix to your challenges, a quick fix to change your team?<br /> <br /> Tools, practices, and methods, are nicely labeled things that we can buy. We could be fooled into thinking that they are magic pills.<br /> <br /> They are not.<br /> <br /> They translate the learning of others, and from that perspective, they are beneficial for our organization innovation journey.<br /> <br /> This session is for managers that are aware of the urge to transform their organization, or for individual contributors that want to foster change. You can apply the learnings from this session whatever your position is as long as you are an insider."
"The upstream linux kernel code base is large and complex. The changes are voluminous. Testing these changes is challenging because of the speed and the diversity of the changes. Many companies are attempting tackle this problem through the use of automation and CI (continuous integration).<br /> <br /> However, just throwing bots at the source code and building it can only solve so many problems. Upstream folks have said that kernel drivers account for the bulk of the churn in the code. Therefore any automated and CI solution needs to handle the diversity of hardware required to verify all the changes.<br /> <br /> This talk will discuss what Red Hat is doing in this space and how we will contribute to stabilizing the upstream linux kernel using our Enterprise class hardware."
"We will present the LeApp project and demonstrate the ability to automate the containerization of applications detected on systems and what else the LeApp platform is capable of (Migrations, upgrades...)<br /> <br /> We would like to stimulate the interest for the project with this presentation to make people aware of what the project is capable of, however it's still in the beginning and will need external contributors to support more applications to be convertible.<br /> <br /> => Max attendees? TBH I don't know <br /> => No pre requirements for this session (except for container base knowledge (what is a container etc))<br /> <br /> Side Note: This is my first submission for a talk to a conference so please for give me on this abstract - I hope it's good enough :S"
"Whether you've lost track of what's going on with Project Atomic, or whether you're a regular Atomic Host user, this retrospective and BOF is for you. We'll catch you up on the last year and more of Atomic development, including micro-presentations from contributors to various projects, including:<br /> <br /> * Fedora Atomic Host & FLIBS<br /> * CentOS Container Pipeline<br /> * Atomic CLI<br /> * Buildah, CRI-O, Skopeo and other Docker alternatives<br /> * RPM-Ostree<br /> * Atomic Workstation<br /> <br /> Following a whirlwind of project updates, it's time for you to speak. Tell us which technologies you're using and how. Bring questions and deployment blockers you want to discuss. Ask us about our plans and roadmap. This is a session for the Atomic community, and you're it!"
"Fuzz testing is one of the software testing methods besides functional<br /> testing, performance testing, etc. It used to find exceptions such as crashes,<br /> failing built-in code assertions or potential memory leaks by providing<br /> invalid, unexpected, or random data input.<br /> <br /> In this topic we will talk about how fuzz testing make Linux kernel more stable.<br /> First we will talk about the principle of fuzz testing. Then the types of<br /> fuzzers, what's the difference, what's the good and bad points. How the kernel<br /> fuzz testing development. And the last, how the new generation fuzz tool,<br /> syz-kaller, works.<br /> <br /> The topic talks only the basic theory and no experience needed. With this<br /> topic attendees will know how fuzz testing works and find bugs. How to add new<br /> feature test cases when develop new kernel features."
"We want the composition of packages in our operating system to be in an “always ready” state: functioning, integrated, and coherent with one another. Continuous integration (CI) is absolutely essential for this. We show a few key pieces from the developer perspective: Tests in dist-git, CI pipeline, discoverable tests and results with a pull request workflow in Pagure and a Fedora OS that only accepts properly tested changes. Most of the tests currently in Fedora dist-git originate from Red Hat internal QE. We show what happens before a pull request lands in a Fedora package repository to the benefit of both upstream and downstream."
"Government, medical, financial, and other organizations need to track what users and administrators do on critical systems. Up to recording everything they see on the screen, the commands they execute, and files they access.<br /> <br /> While there are many capable solutions for session recording, which can centrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such open-source code. All we have is script(1), sudo I/O logging, and TTY audit. This presentation will show an approach suitable for the modern enterprise, and will include a demo of centralized recording and playback.<br /> <br /> The intended audience is developers, as well as system administrators and security officers responsible for maintaining critical systems and preventing insider attacks.<br /> <br /> Short project intro: http://scribery.github.io"
"In TechFides we implement bigger web applications for demanding customers who wants to have stable enviroments with great on time delivery. That means we need to have strong, stable, secure and fast server infrastructure. I will describe our lessons learned, I will present the most important parts, integrations and tools we are using and I will tell you something more about the big blackout in OVH (The number 3 internet hosting company in the world) which affects thousands IT projects in Europe."
"OpenStack is a complex distributed system to manage infrastructure programmatically. So far, the most common way to deploy it is by installing it on baremetal. However, if you look at it closer, the services that OpenStack is built by are very much cloud like applications that can be deployed on containers.<br /> <br /> Ansible is a management tool that allows for various operations including configuration management, provisioning and resource management.<br /> <br /> Join me in this presentation where I'll show how it's possible to manage Kubernetes resources using Ansible and the Kubernetes' API (no external requirements) to deploy complex applications like OpenStack."
"With Java 9, the default garbage collector is changed from Parallel to G1 collector. But what are the differences between G1 and Parallel garbage collector? Why should we learn about G1 collector and why G1 is the default collector in Java 9? <br /> <br /> In this session, we are going to discuss benefits compared to Parallel and CMS GC, a detailed overview of G1 like it's heap structure, marking and full GC cycles, and ergonomic defaults for G1. We’ll also discuss how does G1 GC work internally. <br /> <br /> After this session, you’ll understand the working and main goal of G1 garbage collector and how to tune G1 collector and analyze G1 garbage collection logging. <br /> <br /> Resource link:<br /> [1] https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector.htm#JSGCT-GUID-ED3AB6D3-FD9B-4447-9EDF-983ED2F7A573"
"Vert.x is the leading JVM-based stack for developing asynchronous, event-driven applications. Traditional ACID transactions, especially distributed transactions, are typically difficult to use in such an environment due to their blocking nature. However, the transactional actor model, which pre-dates Java, has been successful in a number of areas over the years. In this talk you will learn how we have been integrating this model using Narayana transactions, Software Transactional Memory and Vert.x. Michael will go through an example and show how Vert.x developers can now utilise volatile, persistent and nested transactions in their applications, as well as what this might mean for enterprise deployments."
"Have you ever used iperf or netperf and thought that it is missing<br /> support for a socket option that you wanted to try out?<br /> <br /> If so then <a href='https://github.com/rushit-tool/rushit' target='_blank'>rushit</a> [1] may be the tool for you. It aims to be a<br /> performance testing tool, similar to iperf/netperf, that simulates a<br /> network workload. However it also lets you tweak the workload with Lua<br /> scripts that run as an integral part of the network threads. To top it<br /> off you can process the test results in your script too!<br /> <br /> The talk will introduce you to the rushit tool. We will see how its<br /> design compares to other tools. We will also learn how rushit takes it<br /> a step further and lets you script parts of the workload with Lua. And<br /> finally we will go through sample use-cases.<br /> <br /> [1] https://github.com/rushit-tool/rushit"
"I want to give a overview about the Nouveau project and what challenges we deal with reverse engineering Nvidia GPUs. This includes security mechanisms Nvidia added over time to their GPUs to prevent us from doing our job. Having an open source GPU driver is important, because nearly everything somebody does on their Linux driven machine goes through the graphical stack and therefore a lot of sensible information goes through it and why should we trust closed source software with our stuff? Main topics will be which parts of the graphics stack we work on, our goals, what we have achieved already, what tools we are working with to trace the Nvidia driver, how somebody interested in this project can help out, what we currently are working on and what I would like to see implemented next."
"Authentication is a major component of security, but is often implemented as a password-based solution even though stronger and more secure alternatives exist.<br /> This talk will explain the risks associated to password-based authentication, describe the advantages of two-factor authentication, and demonstrate how open source software such as FreeIPA (http://www.freeipa.org) can help deploy an infrastructure for Smart Card authentication with X509 certificates."
"The talk provides an overview of some techniques used for development, (back- and forward-) porting, and packaging of out-of-tree kernel modules for the various Linux distributions."
"Interested in Fedora, where it is headed, and what vision the various Fedora leadership has for the project? The Fedora Panel is the perfect opportunity to find the answers to those questions. Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller, various members from the Fedora Council, FESCo, and other community leaders will be present to do a Q&A with audience members across a wide range of topics pertaining to Fedora. Come and be part of the community that helps drive Fedora direction!"
"Kotlin is now gaining popularity as a programming language especially for the Android development. But Kotlin is not focused only on JVM, it also compiles to JavaScript and there is a new experimental native code compilation.<br /> You can write parts of your code once for multiple targets. Let's look into how to do it.<br /> <br /> Links: https://kotlinlang.org/<br /> Expected outcome: Developer can write simple multi-platform application for Android, classic JVM, Node.js, client-side JavaScript and native (iOS)."
"ShuHaRi is an old martial art concept of learning from Japan. The concept teaches the 3 stages one needs to master a technique : Shu (obey), Ha (digress), Ri (separate). <br /> <br /> Many teams nowadays try to use the Scrum or Kanban framework for developing software but forget to understand the basics before modifications to create a process that fits their needs.If we modify elements without understanding the concept with a lack of foundational knowledge the system can collapse. After successfully understanding the basic concepts of a process, teams should “break” rules and try initiatives to remove wasteful actions in their daily work. When teams understand their situation is unique they can find a natural way to work and truly become agile."
"The provisioning of services in Openshift is done through the Open Service Broker API. The session covers the Ansible Service Broker implementations and shows how the Red Hat Mobile team uses it to provision other Red Hat services. The session shows the required part for creating Ansible Playbook Bundles, which are executed for the provisioning under the covers. After the session the audience will be able to start programming their on Ansible Playbook Bundles"
"This may come as a surprise but it is already possible to run nested KVM inside Hyper-V VMs (and this includes several instance types on Azure). Such workloads, however, may not always perform very well. Some limitations come from x86 architecture and conceptual differences between KVM and Hyper-V, other issues could be dealt with within KVM. In this talk Vitaly will go through different performance bottlenecks of nested KVM-on-Hyper-V deployments. The presentation will mainly be focused on low-level features: hardware support for nested virtualization, clocksources and clockevents, virtual device drivers. Benchmark data and general thoughts on the usefulness of such deployments won't be missing too."
"SCTP is a transport protocol, side by side with TCP and UDP, originated from SIGTRAN IETF Working Group in the early 2000's with the initial objetive of supporting the transport of PSTN signalling over IP networks. Since then it had numerous improvements that help it serve other purposes too, such as support for partially reliability and stream scheduling. <br /> <br /> In this talk we will do a quick review on SCTP basics, then go through the improvements that were done in the Linux stack in the past 2 years and review a list of what is in our radar for the next steps."
"OpenShift provides an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) logging service which can be used for non-containerized as well as containerized applications. We will present an introduction to this service, a short how-to get it running, and a description of the openshift-ansible playbooks used to configure it for production purposes.<br /> We will describe a couple of different deployment scenarios to collect logs from infrastructure services like oVirt and OpenStack. We will give a brief demonstration of Kibana, troubleshooting Elasticsearch with Kopf and how to monitor Elasticsearch using Prometheus. We will describe the lessons learned. Finally, we will present some short term and longer term plans for the project."
"Intended audience:<br /> The session will be open for all, from people just getting started to seasoned professionals interested in software engineering and patterns/trends<br /> <br /> Abstract:<br /> In modern Software Engineering, the trends challenge the more traditional roles(Dev, QA, Ops) and separation of concerns in the traditional models. Site Reliability Engineering patterns model the next generation of the Software craftsman, who is a combination of Dev, QE and Ops. With self service tooling backed by monitoring and intelligent test automation, the developer can own the testing and also deployments to production. Also get a glance into how Red Hat Developer Tools Team is disrupting the traditional software delivery model with SRE patterns, enabling faster turnaround times for high quality solutions."
"This talk will focus on how we deploy and manage CentOS on our fleet at Facebook, and showcase challenges, best practices and lessons learned working with a deployment of hundreds of thousands of machines. We'll discuss challenges encountered over the years, tools that we developed to overcome them, the process used to integrate upstream updates, packaging tools and workflows and configuration management challenges. The talk is mostly focused on bare metal, but will cover some container best practices as well. We'll also focus on our interactions with the RPM, Yum, Anaconda and systemd projects to showcase how to work with the upstream community."
"Collaborative filtering is a well known method to implement recommendation engines. Although modern techniques, such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS), allow us to perform rating predictions with large amounts of observations, typically ALS is implemented as a distributed batch algorithm where retraining must be performed with the entirety of the data. However, when dealing with large amounts of data as a stream, batch retraining might be problematic. In this talk Rui will guide us in building a streaming ALS implementation using Apache Spark and based on Stochastic Gradient Descent, where training can be performed using observations as they arrive. The advantages of real-time streaming collaborative filtering will be discussed as well as the scenarios where batch ALS might be preferable."
"Intended audience:<br /> Beginner-Intermediate level audience interested in learning about Infrastructure engineering, Scale, Containers, OpenShift or DevOps.<br /> <br /> Abstract:<br /> Scaling a Software as a Service offering can be hard, and requires optimizations on all aspects of a product. From feature teams to infra, everyone works in unison towards this goal. OpenShift.io is an online environment for hybrid cloud applications. This will be a talk about how we handle scale for OpenShift.io, as the demand grows. It covers:<br /> 1. Where we started with scale<br /> 2. What we have done till now<br /> 3. What the future roadmap looks like<br /> <br /> Key Takeaways:<br /> - Understand how Red Hat will be delivering its first Software as a Service product, and know about the lessons learnt by the team while scaling a service."
"Ever wondered what's happening with network packets in the kernel? What all those weird abbreviations such as “skb”, “GSO” and “NAPI” mean? Why sometimes your firewall rules are ignored?<br /> This presentation will be your illustrated introduction guide to the kernel networking. Join a network packet on its tour through the kernel. From its arrival at the network card, through all the different layers up to the final destination: your application. And then back. And forth and back again, this time with some tricks to speed things up.<br /> We won't look into any C code. Instead, we'll focus at how and why things work and what are the ideas behind. No previous experience with kernel coding required. It's enough to have a vague idea that network packets begin with stacked protocol headers."
"Since the debut of the Go programming language in 2009, it has chugged along in a regular cadence. New features, improvements, drawbacks, and my magic 8ball predictions"
"Elytron is a new security framework for WildFly. It can provide various ways of authentication (logging in) and authorization (permissions checks) of user access to an application on application server. Authentication is usually made by username and password, but it can be made by more interesting ways too - including client certificate or various single-sign-on solutions. Also authorization can be more complex than just assigning roles to users from database. In this presentation I would like to show you how you can use Elytron to secure your own Java EE application including EJB beans and how to use Elytron client to connect it."
"From gold images to cloud machine images, the creation and provisioning of systems has moved steadily away from remote installation to uploading finished artifacts. Infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure need a different way of shipping new packages and updating available images than a remote yum update.<br /> <br /> We'll explore some tools like lorax to define the system build, livemedia-creator create an image and convert to multiple formats. We'll also discuss where configuration fits in the process and talk about how to manage versions.<br /> <br /> After this session, you'll know:<br /> * what tools are available today<br /> * how to build a common system image for multiple platforms<br /> * what we need to consider in image lifecycles"
"In this short session I will present the results of using Fedora 27 Modular server in real world use cases in Fedora Infrastructure. Creating, Deploying and keeping updated Fedora 27 modular server instances will be covered as well as pitfalls and shortcomings and future promise. Attendees will leave the session with information on how they too could best leverage Modular Server and how that might change over the coming year."
"Features and stability are often mutually exclusive for early adopters. With Fedora, this means using 'rawhide'. One of the major complaints of rawhide users is that it is often broken, untested and hard to use with a lot of issues. There is an ongoing initiative to gate rawhide, with the aim of making it always at least Alpha quality. We are working to gate the nigthtly rawhide release, with the help of tools like OpenQA, ResultsDB, Greenwave, fedmsg and others. These tools will help decide whether or not the compose is ready for publication. This new process simplifies the life of early adopters and enables them to focus on helping us find real bugs. Come find out how the Fedora developers are bringing this to life and how you can implement it in your projects."
"Over the last year, Fedora has automated the package signing. In this talk, I hope to explain how this is working, how things are secured and the future plans.<br /> For this, I will be starting with a short summary on Sigul (https://pagure.io/sigul/) and Koji, and then discuss how Robosignatory (https://pagure.io/robosignatory) ties it all together, and how it plays with Bodhi."
"Fedora Atomic Workstation provides a new desktop experience powered by rpm-ostree, flatpak, and docker. There are many benefits to this combination that should make Fedora Atomic Workstation an attractive choice, some of which include:<br /> - transactional updates: never fear updating again, even across major releases<br /> - clear separation of host and apps: flatpaks and docker containers are updated on their own cadence and have little impact on host requirements (and vice-versa)<br /> - other rpm-ostree features such as immutability, update rollbacks, and effortless package tracking<br /> <br /> In this session, you will learn:<br /> - why Fedora Atomic Workstation is awesome,<br /> - what you can accomplish on Fedora Atomic Workstation, and<br /> - how you can get started.<br /> <br /> This session has no requirements."
"Various container build services offer developers to build their image with a git push and scan the container for known CVEs (as a paid service). What they don't provide is Dockerfile linting; scanners that would scan for available package updates (rpm, pip, npm, gem); a build process that rebuilds an image not only on git push but also when there's RPM update in its enabled repo or when its base image is updated.<br /> <br /> Welcome to CentOS Container Pipeline project. It provides all these and more, out of the box, free of cost, on CentOS infra, and with focus on open source developers. All it needs is link to git repo containing the Dockerfile. And also email address to provide all that helpful information. ;)"
"Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at automation.<br /> <br /> The main design features of the tool include:<br /> * Parallel execution<br /> * Event driven mechanism<br /> * Distributed architecture<br /> And a:<br /> * Declarative, Functional, Reactive programming language.<br /> <br /> The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.<br /> This presentation will demo both and include many interactive examples showing you how to build reactive, autonomous, real-time systems.<br /> Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.<br /> <br /> A number of blog posts on the subject are available: https://ttboj.wordpress.com/?s=mgmtconfig<br /> Attendees are encouraged to read some before the talk if they want a preview!"
"Today DevOps initiatives are more or less focusing on Automation and tools.<br /> Now we have the tools but lacking on picking up the cultural aspects.<br /> Everything starts with how we are perceiving it. Does the organisations have a 'us vs. them' culture or a 'we' culture? <br /> DevOps centres on concept of sharing : sharing ideas, issues, process, tools and goals.<br /> What are the common misconceptions? Why is it happening? <br /> It is as much about culture as it is about tools,<br /> and culture is all about people. Thus it has a lot to do with human components and processes.<br /> <br /> This talk will discuss the benefits of elaborating operations understanding among the whole team and looking into correcting the common failures."
"Flatpaks are a new way of distributing applications with bundled<br /> dependencies so that a single binary can run across multiple versions<br /> of a distribution and even on different distributions. While Flatpaks<br /> are often built directly from source, building them from distribution<br /> packages allows leveraging the distribution's existing package set and<br /> security update process.<br /> <br /> This talk will discuss how and why Fedora is extending its build<br /> system to generate Flatpaks and Flatpak runtimes, how this relates to<br /> building server-side containers and to modularity, and demonstrate the<br /> packager-side view of the process. Attendees will learn how Flatpak<br /> relates to the traditional distribution packaging mechanisms, and will<br /> hopefully be inspired to help convert Fedora applications to Flatpaks."
"Will hardware offload help Open vSwitch to scale above 10G, and keep the CPU cool?<br /> <br /> Our journey starts with why hardware offload is needed for Open vSwitch? Can we scale consuming more and more CPU resources for handling networking traffic?<br /> <br /> What can hardware bring to the table to help us free these CPU resources for the real task at hand, i.e. running containers and/or virtual machines?<br /> <br /> If the hardware can help, how will this all be utilized in a vendor natural way? TC Flower to the rescue...<br /> <br /> But what is TC Flower, how does it work, and finally how does it integrate with Open vSwitch. <br /> <br /> And for the conclusion... How well will Open vSwitch with TC Flower perform? We will present the results based on our tests using the Physical to Virtual to Physical (PVP) test methodology."

"The author - during his several years of senior technical support engineer - hit various embarrassing bugs in products he does support for. Each of them with fatal impact to the relevant product or component.<br /> <br /> The talk will describe the bugs on a higher level and pinpoint their root causes. The aim of the presentation is to make attendees more aware of some 'typical' (from author's subjective experience) and dangerous types of bugs, to prevent those during coding.<br /> <br /> No limit to number of attendees, just basic general programming skills required from them. Rather entertaining (to some extent) than deep-dive talk."
"The Internet today is plagued by many problems. From viruses and spam, to identity theft and piracy.<br /> <br /> We can solve those problems.<br /> <br /> With a virtual operating system that runs the cloud, using blockchains to secure identities and data, a virtual network layer to protect against unauthorized network access, and a virtual machine to sandbox untrusted code.<br /> <br /> This talk will describe Elastos, an Operating System for the smart web.<br /> <br /> It will explore the approach that Elastos takes to achieve these goals, and gives a vision of a possible future internet."
"KVM, kernel based virtualization, turns the Linux kernel into an<br /> hypervisor to provide full virtualization services. There is great<br /> magic that happens in the background to create a guest environment<br /> and provide various services securely.<br /> <br /> In this session we'll peek into the background to understand<br /> how a KVM x86 guest environment comes to be, how/where do various<br /> emulated peripherals fit in and how do they interacts with each-other,<br /> the hypervisor and the hardware."
"Containers seem to be like virtualization, just better. Is it just a matter of time until all VMs will have vanished, and their workloads live their life in containers? Well - This depends on the problem you try to solve.<br /> This talk is about looking at why virtualization is still needed in a container world and where it is found. We’ll specifically look at virtualization related projects like ClearContainers, frakti, virtlet, and KubeVirt in the Kubernetes context, their use-cases, commonalities, and differences.<br /> <br /> After the talk an attendee should have gained overview over which projects exist in the Kubernetes world, and for what they can be used.<br /> <br /> This talk is for everybody who would like to secure their containers, or who would like to run classical VMs on Kubernetes."
"Agile Conversion is tough. Moving from a traditional Waterfall approach of pre defined roles and stages to a model of team ownership is a jarring experience for most teams. Over 12 months and 15 major releases, Red Hat Mobile became a fully functioning Agile team. However there is a hidden side of Agile adoption, the dead ends that we reached, the frustrations within the teams, the roadblocks we hit and the staff turnover that occurred. Things that can not only halt an Agile adoption, but if not dealt with, that can fracture a team that is not prepared for it. This talk will be more encompassing than the path to success, it will cover the trials and tribulations of a team in transition."
"Deduplication and compression have been core requests for Linux storage, but delivering these at performance and scale has been technologically difficult. The new kvdo device-mapper module, based on more than a decade of development, is a tried and tested solution that meets this need. kvdo provides fast, scalable, inline deduplication, compression, and 4K-granularity thin provisioning for any Linux block device. These benefits transfer to file systems and applications using the underlying storage. <br /> <br /> VDO is simple to deploy across many use cases, but a few caveats apply due to the unpredictability of actual space free. This session will provide an overview of VDO and its deployment, a review of usage considerations, and a first-level introduction to its implementation internals."
"Dealing with date and time in code is complicated because numbers are all odd. A day has 86400 seconds, months have between 28 and 31 days, and so on. Leap years, leap seconds and DST add to complexity. <br /> <br /> In fact it's even more complicated. Not only sun and moon influence our calendar system but also math, politics, religion, relativity theory, tidal range, and even Caesar's love for Cleopatra have an impact. Did you ever wonder why a minute has 60 seconds? Why Eastern and Ramadan are always on different dates? Why do we need leap seconds, astronomers UT1 and UT1R besides UTC? What's up with 11 missing days in September of 1752 in some countries or Chicago's time zone '18:09:00 STD, LMT-1'?<br /> <br /> My talk will shed some light on time and calendar systems."
"Ceph is an open-source, horizontally scalable distributed storage system for object, block, and file workloads. But Ceph is more than just storage: it embeds powerful programmability features, some available to unprivileged users and others restricted to deployment by cluster admins. Learn how to embed and trigger custom code via “object classes”. Case studies on how they are used by major components of the Ceph storage system illustrate the power of embedding code into your storage system, and the accessible extensibility it offers. See how client-specified “compound operations” extend the storage system to allow better synchronization and smarter storage even for normal users."
"Security is hard, yet vital for any software these days. After all you don't want to become the laughing stock on hacker news or cause your company to loose billions in shareholder value. This talk won't turn you into a security specialist over night, but you will learn how to avoid common mistakes in your daily work as developer or administrator. I'm going to take you on a brief tour in secure software design, illustrate various attack vectors, and point you to helpful tools and resources. Topics include threat analysis, deployment, parsing, authentication, TLS/SSL, crypto, and user interaction, with some real life examples from my daily work.<br /> <br /> 30 minutes version from PyCon UK: https://speakerdeck.com/tiran/pycon-uk-2017-everyday-security-issues-and-how-to-avoid-them"
"Even the best system administrator cannot always avoid any and every disaster that may plague his data center, but he should have a contingency plan to recover from one - and an administrator that manages his virtual data centers with oVirt is of course no different.<br /> This session will showcase how Ansible can be used to leverage the new APIs introduced in oVirt 4.2 to create a fully-fledged DR strategy."
"The boom boot manager allows system administrators to easily create and modify boot entries using a BootLoader Specification compliant boot loader.<br /> <br /> Bryn Reeves introduces the tool and Python libraries and demonstrates common tasks: configuring boom to boot a snapshot of the system, and cloning and modifying existing boot entries."
"Looking for an easy way to automate networking on your RHEL/Fedora system? Do you have systems with multiple versions? Do you need to know what is on the horizon for RHEL networking and Ansible? If so, this presentation will give you an in-depth view of current capabilities of automating your networking with Ansible RHEL System Roles. The session will walk you through playbooks and roles to show how to build simple and complex networking topologies. A live demo will demonstrate creating a complex network using Ansible and pass traffic over it. Finally, the presentation will also provide a glimpse of what is upcoming in Ansible networking for RHEL."
"Murky requirements and organic growth over time create monsters. Engineers<br /> know them as legacy processes; every worthwhile endeavor has them and a<br /> healthy code environment requires their removal. The session will break down<br /> how we are getting rid of manual processes in the Fedora release engineering<br /> world with a sprinkling of anecdotes from previous experiences.<br /> <br /> Attendee Information:<br /> - no limit on the number of attendees<br /> - should have a moderate development background<br /> - experience with automation tools usch as Ansible by Red Hat helps<br /> - Agile terms will be discussed but no prior Agile experience required<br /> <br /> Attendee Takeaways:<br /> - a better understanding of how to tackle large scale legacy retrofits<br /> - insight into how the Agile methodology makes change easier"
"D-Bus is the Linux message bus system. Tmds.DBus is OSS .NET library to connect .NET Core applications to D-Bus. In this session I'll explain how Tmds.DBus can be used to connect .NET Core apps to D-Bus and explain how Tmds.DBus works.<br /> <br /> The audience should be familiar with D-Bus and have .NET development experience.<br /> <br /> I am the maintainer of Tmds.DBus.<br /> https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.DBus/"
"Automatic detection of backward incompatibilities in Go package updates. Important in CI/CD pipeline where we want to build Go project updates without human intervention. The talk will summarize current issues connected to updates and present a tooling that helps to discover backward incompatibilities in updates."
"SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a standard designed to support automated configuration, vulnerability checking, and security measurement. <br /> Using OpenSCAP, an open source SCAP scanner, and SCAP Security Guide Project (SSG) a project focused on creating SCAP content for multiple platforms, this session will present how to scan and secure your containers.<br /> However, SCAP was not designed with containers in mind and things don't fit perfectly. We will also discuss some challenges we faced regarding compliance in systems built on containers and future plans."
"In GoodData we use OpenStack as a backbone of our cloud infrastructure. We specialize in Business Intelligence, mostly embedded analytics. We use various Open Source software to do our job and deliver results to our customers from their precious data. This mean real time computing of huge amount of data. By huge I mean many TBs. In this presentation I will describe our cloud infrastructure, talk about how we use OpenStack and what kind of problem we encounter every day. I hope this presentation can help users not to do our mistakes and will help developers to make (mostly) Open Stack better. <br /> <br /> I will show how and what we use from OpenStack and describe it in details. I will also briefly discuss what we want to implement in near future and what kind of storage and hardware we are using."
"The CentOS CI Infrastructure provides infrastructure resources for groups like the Fedora Atomic Pipeline (upstream), CentOS Linux (downstream), Openshift Origin (sorta-upstream in the CentOS PaaS SIG) and systemd (way-upstream). In this session, we'll go over some of the latest happenings in CentOS CI, talk about new features in the infrastructure, and describe the upstream - midstream - downstream community that we'd like to build together with you."
"Secure systems are built on a layered model. You ultimately have to trust something - but what? <br /> <br /> TPM 2.0 is a Hardware RoT (Root of Trust), including the TPM 2.0 module, the TCG Software Stack (TSS), operations it can perform, and userspace tools that simplify using TPM 2.0. We also cover the TPM 2.0 Resource Manager, a new feature that is critical to enabling multiple users and applications to use the TPM. In addition we will go over the implementation of TPM in Fedora and RHEL.<br /> <br /> We will demo TPM using Clevis to automatically unlock an encrypted root volume on boot with the master key secured by TPM.<br /> <br /> Beyond Clevis we will explore other uses of TPM 2.0 including Trusted Boot, secure systems identity, protected keyring, and protected certificates."
"Endless is building a Linux desktop OS for the next billion consumers, aiming to make desktop computing practical and affordable so people can learn and create with technology.<br /> <br /> Starting from a 'clean slate' in 2012 allowed us to develop a 'legacy free' Linux core OS platform using OStree from the very start, and adopting Flatpak in 2016 as it reached usability/maturity, to replace our own home-grown app bundling system.<br /> <br /> Focusing on ostree and Flatpak, this session will detail our reasons for choosing these technologies, our experience from being early adopters in production, and the strengths, weaknesses and potential improvements we found.<br /> <br /> Endless OS: https://endlessos.com/for-developers/<br /> OSTree: https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/<br /> Flatpak: http://flatpak.org/"
"Container images are known to be compressible. But there is no comprehensive evaluation of how much storage space can be saved through storage features such as compression and deduplication. <br /> <br /> This talk presents quantitative findings of Container image reduction under different workloads using Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO) developed by Permabit and recently acquired by Red Hat. We discovered that storage space savings range between 50% and 85% on different workloads. <br /> <br /> Building on these findings, we created an optimized Docker registry service on OpenShift that is capable of reducing storage spaces used by CI/CD by almost a magnitude."
"Everyone knows what CRUD means - Create, Read, Update and Delete... But wait, what is actually an Update?<br /> Does writer “update” an article or does he “publish” it?<br /> Do customers “update” an order or do they “pay” for it?<br /> Does your happy boss “update” your salary or does she “raise” it?<br /> Generic CRUD approach does not represent a real-life experience and makes both your user interface and API harder to understand and maintain.<br /> This talk covers differences between Rich Domain Model and Anemic Domain Model, their advantages and disadvantages, and how these concepts affect the design of your model, forms and user interface."
"THIS ROOM IS UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br>"
"To fit more guests into system, we need to reduce memory footprint of individual guests. Our observation is big part of guest memory is page cache. Guest page cache grows large because of guest disk read/write accesses and there is no coordination between guest & host which pages should be swapped out when there is memory pressure at host side.&lt;br&gt;In this talk we will present solution to this problem. How we are eliminating guest page cache using QEMU fake DAX (Direct access) with guest persistent memory range. Also, we will discuss design & implementation details of new flushing interface required to persist guest changes to the backing storage. In addition to this, we will also talk about KVM guest page hinting and how both the above solutions help to solve the actual problem.<br>"
"virt-v2v is a tool to convert virtual machines from foreign guests to KVM. oVirt is a datacenter virtualization solution managing KVM guests. ManageIQ is a cloud management platform managing both VMware and oVirt (and many others).&lt;br&gt;We have integrated all this to provide an easy migration of VMware guests to oVirt using ManageIQ. &lt;br&gt;In this talk all layers of this integration will be explained giving the audience a firm understanding of how the journey of the virtual machine from VMware to oVirt looks like and how it can be customized.&lt;br&gt;No prior experience from the audience expected.<br>"
"Microservices are exciting to build but complex to manage and operate. In this session you will see a live demo of polyglot microservices application and how a day in a developers life looks like when they have to take a change into production without risking any production downtime using a continuous delivery pipeline and zero downtime deployment techniques such as blue/green deployment. But what about security? We will also show how to integrate security scanning into the deployment pipeline to make sure no changes go into production with known security risks."
"Kernel developers have always been concerned with fixing bugs, especially when those bugs have security implications. There's been an effort recently towards more proactive security efforts to eliminate the severity of certain types of bugs. This effort has been given the name the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP). The goal of this talk is to give a brief introduction to kernel security and discuss both the technical and non-technical challenges to making the kernel more secure, including why this hasn't happened sooner."
"The last year has been a whirlwind: lots of changes that affect us all, our toolchain, our workflows, and the shape of the Linux distribution. This hour is time set aside for open questions. How did the last year go? What’s coming next? We’ll be offering our opinions and guidance on questions from Modularity to “robots” to Bikeshed to gating. Join the discussion and help us create the future, together.<br /> <br /> ---<br /> <br /> For the committee: We plan to put the Factory 2.0 team up on the stage and take questions from the audience. If the room is quiet, we’ll have ~12 pre-canned questions prepared just to get things going. We understand that this is very unstructured compared to most devconf sessions, but with the committee’s approval we’d like to experiment and try it."
"Java is language, which turned from rapid development and innovation, to stagnation, which escalated with JDK6 being stable JDK for 6 years.<br /> With JDK7 come an promise to speed up the development with feature-focused cycle of 2-3 years. JDK8 was in edge, and JDK9 come wrong.<br /> Based on this experience, JDK will no longer be feature driven, and will try to release every half an year with LTS releases in 2-3 years.<br /> This change is forcing in many interesting subjects like complete fade-in of OpenJDK (as reference implementation) with OralcleJDK. RedHat had its part in this whole process, and I will try to highlight major impacts of the new release cycle."
"Last year, we asked 90 developers to generate/validate certificates using the command line OpenSSL. Why didn't they succeed? What do people think of the interface? What's wrong with the manual page and what do online tutorials lack? And what can be changed to improve the situation?<br /> <br /> In our research, we focused on API of OpenSSL, a widely-known cryptographic library. We'll present multiple insights from the DevConf 2017 research booth, answering the questions from the previous paragraph.<br /> <br /> We use OpenSSL as a real-world example to spark conversation on usable security. How to make products that are not only computationally secure but also usably secure for the end-users (be it your system administrator or your granny)?"
"Pagure (https://pagure.io) has been changing quite a bit over the last months, this presentation aims at providing an overview of the changes that were implemented, bugs fixes and features added.<br /> Being a simple pagure user or just curious about this, you might have missed a few of the features that were added. We will try to go through the main ones, present the ones we are planning on and leave time for questions or live feature requests!"
"Openshift is becoming more and more relevant in the container platform and PAAS area, with many developers and organizations already using it in production to deliver large scale, mission critical apps.<br /> In this area, some of the most appreciated and used features are related to the advanced deployment techniques.<br /> Since Openshift can easily spawn different versions of the same application and send traffic to them , it is an obvious option to help you implement rolling updates, Blue / Green deployments, canary and so on.<br /> In this talk, we will start introducing different techniques on how to implement content based routing, in order to have advanced routing based on request / client supplied informations. We will talk about HAproxy, Camel and Istio."
"Simple Signing (https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891) is a new and simple way to sign your containers images and enforce policies around image pulls. CRI-O (cri-o.io) is a new Kubernetes container runtime which seamlessly integrates Simple Signing, thus having the ability to secure your Kubernetes nodes in a cluster.<br /> In this talk Antonio is going to explain how containers images Simple Signing (https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891) works. He will dive into how you can sign your containers images with GPG keys using skopeo, serve containers signatures and actually enforce policies around image pulls in your Kubernetes cluster running CRI-O as its container runtime. The talk includes a demo to recap everything explained as well."
"Enterprise grade patching management tools for Linux can be either quite expensive or complex to set up and maintain. Tools like dnf-automatic and yum-cron have substantial limitations when deploying at scale or where there are more complex requirements. <br /> <br /> Auter is a tool written to provide some of the advantages of those patching tools but managed by each host. Auter is a host based, highly configurable method for patching. Advantages include executing custom scripts at different stages of the update process, optional automatic reboots after updates have been applied and the ability to deploying staggered, version controlled updates across multiple environments. Large scale reporting and co-ordination can be provided via existing CM platforms such as ansible, chef, puppet."
