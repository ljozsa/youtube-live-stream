What features in the kernel are needed and why, what syscalls and arguments and how to put them together are the questions answered. We will slowly put together a simple and naive implementation of a linux container. The goal is to understand how it works and thus understand the limitations and features available. Some of the aspects of real world containers are not covered at all some just in a very simpilified manner as these are topics in itself.","Vilibald Wanča","A-D105",,"Containers"

One of the major complaints of rawhide users is that it is often broken, untested and hard to use with a lot of issues. There is an ongoing initiative to gate rawhide, with the aim of making it always at least Alpha quality. We are working to gate the nigthtly rawhide release, with the help of tools like OpenQA, ResultsDB, Greenwave, fedmsg and others. These tools will help decide whether or not the compose is ready for publication. This new process simplifies the life of early adopters and enables them to focus on helping us find real bugs. Come find out how the Fedora developers are bringing this to life and how you can implement it in your projects.","Mohan Boddu","F-E104",,"Automation,DevOps,Platform/OS,Testing"

Is it just a matter of time until all VMs will have vanished, and their workloads live their life in containers? Well - This depends on the problem you try to solve. This talk is about looking at why virtualization is still needed in a container world and where it is found. We’ll specifically look at virtualization related projects like ClearContainers, frakti, virtlet, and KubeVirt in the Kubernetes context, their use-cases, commonalities, and differences.  After the talk an attendee should have gained overview over which projects exist in the Kubernetes world, and for what they can be used.

Our observation is big part of guest memory is page cache. Guest page cache grows large because of guest disk read/write accesses and there is no coordination between guest & host which pages should be swapped out when there is memory pressure at host side.&lt;br&gt;In this talk we will present solution to this problem. How we are eliminating guest page cache using QEMU fake DAX (Direct access) with guest persistent memory range. Also, we will discuss design & implementation details of new flushing interface required to persist guest changes to the backing storage. In addition to this, we will also talk about KVM guest page hinting and how both the above solutions help to solve the actual problem.","Pankaj Gupta","G-E105",,

With JDK7 come an promise to speed up the development with feature-focused cycle of 2-3 years. JDK8 was in edge, and JDK9 come wrong. Based on this experience, JDK will no longer be feature driven, and will try to release every half an year with LTS releases in 2-3 years. This change is forcing in many interesting subjects like complete fade-in of OpenJDK (as reference implementation) with OralcleJDK.
