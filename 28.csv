There are many benefits to this combination that should make Fedora Atomic Workstation an attractive choice, some of which include: - transactional updates: never fear updating again, even across major releases - clear separation of host and apps: flatpaks and docker containers are updated on their own cadence and have little impact on host requirements (and vice-versa) - other rpm-ostree features such as immutability, update rollbacks, and effortless package tracking  In this session, you will learn: - why Fedora Atomic Workstation is awesome, - what you can accomplish on Fedora Atomic Workstation, and - how you can get started.  This session has no requirements.","Jonathan Lebon","H-E112",,"Containers,Desktop,Development,Platform/OS"

The main design features of the tool include: * Parallel execution * Event driven mechanism * Distributed architecture And a: * Declarative, Functional, Reactive programming language.  The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language. This presentation will demo both and include many interactive examples showing you how to build reactive, autonomous, real-time systems. Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.  A number of blog posts on the subject are available: https://ttboj.wordpress.com/?s=mgmtconfig Attendees are encouraged to read some before the talk if they want a preview!","James Shubin","F-E104",,"Automation,Configuration Management,DevOps"

Now we have the tools but lacking on picking up the cultural aspects. Everything starts with how we are perceiving it. Does the organisations have a 'us vs. them' culture or a 'we' culture?  DevOps centres on concept of sharing : sharing ideas, issues, process, tools and goals. What are the common misconceptions? Why is it happening?  It is as much about culture as it is about tools, and culture is all about people. Thus it has a lot to do with human components and processes.  This talk will discuss the benefits of elaborating operations understanding among the whole team and looking into correcting the common failures.","Syam G Krishnan","F-E104",,"Development,DevOps"

Each of them with fatal impact to the relevant product or component.  The talk will describe the bugs on a higher level and pinpoint their root causes. The aim of the presentation is to make attendees more aware of some 'typical' (from author's subjective experience) and dangerous types of bugs, to prevent those during coding.  No limit to number of attendees, just basic general programming skills required from them. Rather entertaining (to some extent) than deep-dive talk.","Pavel Moravec","F-E104",,"Development"

Moving from a traditional Waterfall approach of pre defined roles and stages to a model of team ownership is a jarring experience for most teams. Over 12 months and 15 major releases, Red Hat Mobile became a fully functioning Agile team. However there is a hidden side of Agile adoption, the dead ends that we reached, the frustrations within the teams, the roadblocks we hit and the staff turnover that occurred. Things that can not only halt an Agile adoption, but if not dealt with, that can fracture a team that is not prepared for it. This talk will be more encompassing than the path to success, it will cover the trials and tribulations of a team in transition.","Brendan O Farrell; Laura Fitzgerald","G-E105",,"Agile"

After all you don't want to become the laughing stock on hacker news or cause your company to loose billions in shareholder value. This talk won't turn you into a security specialist over night, but you will learn how to avoid common mistakes in your daily work as developer or administrator. I'm going to take you on a brief tour in secure software design, illustrate various attack vectors, and point you to helpful tools and resources. Topics include threat analysis, deployment, parsing, authentication, TLS/SSL, crypto, and user interaction, with some real life examples from my daily work.  30 minutes version from PyCon UK: https://speakerdeck.com/tiran/pycon-uk-2017-everyday-security-issues-and-how-to-avoid-them","Christian Heimes","C-D0207",,"Security"

The Haskell community publishes packages to http://hackage.haskell.org. http://stackage.org releases consistent collections of a subset of about 2500 Haskell packages buildable with a specific version of GHC. The hundreds of Fedora Haskell packages are tracking versions from the Stackage LTS stream.  In this talk we present and discuss the workflow and tooling that largely automates both the packaging, updating and ordered building of Fedora Haskell packages. We will discuss the steps to get CI working for Haskell packages in Fedora.  The main tools are: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-rpm http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fedora-haskell-tools","Jens Petersen","A-D105",,"Automation,Development,Platform/OS"

In this talk I'll describe what advantages Atomic Workstation has over a regular Fedora Workstation, discuss how it differs from a regular Fedora installation, talk a bit about the technologies involved (ostree, flatpak) and give an overview of the current state of affairs in Fedora 28. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/Atomic","Kalev Lember","A-D105",,"Desktop,Development,Platform/OS"

The dbus-broker project is a new implementation of a message bus as defined by the D-Bus specification. Its aim is to provide high performance and reliability, while keeping compatibility to the D-Bus reference implementation. It is exclusively written for linux systems, and makes use of many modern features provided by recent linux kernel releases.  This session introduces dbus-broker, with a focus on the motivations behind starting the project and the differences compared with the reference implementation.

Programs like admin scripts, Cockpit, Ansible, Powershell all have the same root problem to interface with a Linux machine: there is no standard protocol and API to configure, control and monitor the machine programmatically. This results in proxying CLI commands and parsing the output in various formats. As a solution to this widespread problem, we introduce varlink. Varlink is an interface description format and protocol that aims to make services accessible to both humans and machines in the simplest feasible way.

It's incredibly difficult for the volunteer package maintainers to keep up with this number of upstream projects. Let's automate it!  Anitya is a release monitoring project that integrates with libraries.io to map upstream projects to distribution packages. The session will cover its new REST API, the ZeroMQ messages it emits, and some of the ways Fedora uses these. At the end of this session, attendees will be able to work with Anitya to make the lives of their favorite distribution's maintainers easier.

Tools like dnf-automatic and yum-cron have substantial limitations when deploying at scale or where there are more complex requirements.   Auter is a tool written to provide some of the advantages of those patching tools but managed by each host. Auter is a host based, highly configurable method for patching. Advantages include executing custom scripts at different stages of the update process, optional automatic reboots after updates have been applied and the ability to deploying staggered, version controlled updates across multiple environments. Large scale reporting and co-ordination can be provided via existing CM platforms such as ansible, chef, puppet.","Paolo Gigante","F-E104",,"Automation,DevOps,Platform/OS"

In this session we'll learn about:  - The design behind its use in Project Atomic for servers - Where it fits into the big picture of software including 'system containers', Kubernetes/OpenShift, and flatpak - How it contrasts with competitor systems such as Android/CoreOS - New features such as live updates and an available Workstation variant - The future: OCI integration, custom imaging, and more!","Colin Walters","A-D105",,"Containers,Platform/OS"
