Case studies on how they are used by major components of the Ceph storage system illustrate the power of embedding code into your storage system, and the accessible extensibility it offers. See how client-specified “compound operations” extend the storage system to allow better synchronization and smarter storage even for normal users.","Greg Farnum","G-E105",,"Platform/OS,Storage"

In this talk we will focus on Apache Spark’s ALS implementation and discuss the steps we took to build a distributed recommendation engine, focusing on continuous model training and model management. We show that, by splitting the recommendation engine into microservices, we were able to reduce the system’s complexity and produce a robust collaborative filtering platform with support for continuous model training. At the end of this talk, you should be equipped with enough tools and ideas to implement your own collaborative algorithm and avoid some common pitfalls.","Rui Vieira; Sophie Watson","A-D105",,"AI/Machine Learning,Cloud,Containers"

We also cover the TPM 2.0 Resource Manager, a new feature that is critical to enabling multiple users and applications to use the TPM. In addition we will go over the implementation of TPM in Fedora and RHEL.  We will demo TPM using Clevis to automatically unlock an encrypted root volume on boot with the master key secured by TPM.

This talk presents quantitative findings of Container image reduction under different workloads using Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO) developed by Permabit and recently acquired by Red Hat. We discovered that storage space savings range between 50% and 85% on different workloads.   Building on these findings, we created an optimized Docker registry service on OpenShift that is capable of reducing storage spaces used by CI/CD by almost a magnitude.","Huamin Chen; Dennis Keefe","G-E105",,"Automation,Cloud,Containers,Development,DevOps,Kernel,Platform/OS,Research,Storage,Testing,Workload Management,Virtualization"
