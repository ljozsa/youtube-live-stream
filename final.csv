Smart cards are among us for decades, but they are still not widely used on daily basis by most of us, even though they provide significant advantages for both security and usability and all the tools are open source in Linux. Smart cards are no longer only credit-card sized cards, but also more practical USB dongles which are frequently combined with other features such as OTP or U2F, which can take this even further. I will go through architecture of smart cards and show you how they can be used to simplify your work.","Jakub Jelen","C-D0207",,"Desktop,Development,IdentityManagement,Platform/OS,Security"

Kedge is a simple and easy way to define and deploy applications to Kubernetes. It helps developers by simplifying &ldquo;the getting started on Kubernetes experience&rdquo; without compromising on the power of Kubernetes. Among other things it has support for smart completion in editors using the Language Server Protocol. This talk will introduce the simple Kedge format to define Kubernetes applications and demo the complete application lifecycle and workflow with Kedge and minikube/minishift (from local dev environment to production).Project: <a href='https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge' target='_blank'>https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge</a>","Tomáš Král","C-D0207",,"Containers,Development"

Fuzz it!","Fuzz testing is one of the software testing methods besides functional testing, performance testing, etc. It used to find exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions or potential memory leaks by providing invalid, unexpected, or random data input.  In this topic we will talk about how fuzz testing make Linux kernel more stable. First we will talk about the principle of fuzz testing. Then the types of fuzzers, what's the difference, what's the good and bad points. How the kernel fuzz testing development. And the last, how the new generation fuzz tool, syz-kaller, works.  The topic talks only the basic theory and no experience needed. With this topic attendees will know how fuzz testing works and find bugs. How to add new feature test cases when develop new kernel features.","Hangbin Liu","B-D0206",,"Kernel,Testing"

Continuous integration (CI) is absolutely essential for this. We show a few key pieces from the developer perspective: Tests in dist-git, CI pipeline, discoverable tests and results with a pull request workflow in Pagure and a Fedora OS that only accepts properly tested changes. Most of the tests currently in Fedora dist-git originate from Red Hat internal QE. We show what happens before a pull request lands in a Fedora package repository to the benefit of both upstream and downstream.","Serhii Turivnyi; Dominik Perpeet; Rachel Sibley","H-E112",,"Community,Development,Testing"

Up to recording everything they see on the screen, the commands they execute, and files they access.  While there are many capable solutions for session recording, which can centrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such open-source code. All we have is script(1), sudo I/O logging, and TTY audit. This presentation will show an approach suitable for the modern enterprise, and will include a demo of centralized recording and playback.

So far, the most common way to deploy it is by installing it on baremetal. However, if you look at it closer, the services that OpenStack is built by are very much cloud like applications that can be deployed on containers.  Ansible is a management tool that allows for various operations including configuration management, provisioning and resource management.  Join me in this presentation where I'll show how it's possible to manage Kubernetes resources using Ansible and the Kubernetes' API (no external requirements) to deploy complex applications like OpenStack.","Flavio Percoco","H-E112",,"Automation,Configuration Management,Cloud,DevOps,Platform/OS"

Traditional ACID transactions, especially distributed transactions, are typically difficult to use in such an environment due to their blocking nature. However, the transactional actor model, which pre-dates Java, has been successful in a number of areas over the years. In this talk you will learn how we have been integrating this model using Narayana transactions, Software Transactional Memory and Vert.x. Michael will go through an example and show how Vert.x developers can now utilise volatile, persistent and nested transactions in their applications, as well as what this might mean for enterprise deployments.","Michael Musgrove","E-G202",,"Development,Middleware"

If so then <a href='https://github.com/rushit-tool/rushit' target='_blank'>rushit</a> [1] may be the tool for you. It aims to be a performance testing tool, similar to iperf/netperf, that simulates a network workload. However it also lets you tweak the workload with Lua scripts that run as an integral part of the network threads. To top it off you can process the test results in your script too!  The talk will introduce you to the rushit tool. We will see how its design compares to other tools. We will also learn how rushit takes it a step further and lets you script parts of the workload with Lua. And finally we will go through sample use-cases.

This includes security mechanisms Nvidia added over time to their GPUs to prevent us from doing our job. Having an open source GPU driver is important, because nearly everything somebody does on their Linux driven machine goes through the graphical stack and therefore a lot of sensible information goes through it and why should we trust closed source software with our stuff? Main topics will be which parts of the graphics stack we work on, our goals, what we have achieved already, what tools we are working with to trace the Nvidia driver, how somebody interested in this project can help out, what we currently are working on and what I would like to see implemented next.","Karol Herbst","B-D0206",,"Community,Debugging/Tracing,Desktop,Development,Hardware,Kernel"

Such workloads, however, may not always perform very well. Some limitations come from x86 architecture and conceptual differences between KVM and Hyper-V, other issues could be dealt with within KVM. In this talk Vitaly will go through different performance bottlenecks of nested KVM-on-Hyper-V deployments.

However, when dealing with large amounts of data as a stream, batch retraining might be problematic. In this talk Rui will guide us in building a streaming ALS implementation using Apache Spark and based on Stochastic Gradient Descent, where training can be performed using observations as they arrive.

Like all packaging technologies, containers need to be maintained.  Since containers bundle their dependencies, there will be occasions where it is necessary to mass rebuild all of the containers that Fedora distributes. This mass rebuild introduces quite a few challenges for Fedora's infrastrucutre systems, from OpenShift Build System to Bodhi to the container registry. For example, layered images reference containers in the stable tags, so how can Bodhi push out layered image updates if the new base layer hasn't been stabilized yet? How do we ensure that updates that depend on other updates work?

We are working to gate the nigthtly rawhide release, with the help of tools like OpenQA, ResultsDB, Greenwave, fedmsg and others.

While Flatpaks are often built directly from source, building them from distribution packages allows leveraging the distribution's existing package set and security update process.  This talk will discuss how and why Fedora is extending its build system to generate Flatpaks and Flatpak runtimes, how this relates to building server-side containers and to modularity, and demonstrate the packager-side view of the process. Attendees will learn how Flatpak relates to the traditional distribution packaging mechanisms, and will hopefully be inspired to help convert Fedora applications to Flatpaks.","Owen Taylor","E-G202",,"Containers,Desktop,Development,Platform/OS"

If the hardware can help, how will this all be utilized in a vendor natural way? TC Flower to the rescue...

With JDK7 come an promise to speed up the development with feature-focused cycle of 2-3 years. JDK8 was in edge, and JDK9 come wrong. Based on this experience, JDK will no longer be feature driven, and will try to release every half an year with LTS releases in 2-3 years. This change is forcing in many interesting subjects like complete fade-in of OpenJDK (as reference implementation) with OralcleJDK. RedHat had its part in this whole process, and I will try to highlight major impacts of the new release cycle.","Jiří Vaněk","E-G202",,"Development,Middleware,Platform/OS,Security"
